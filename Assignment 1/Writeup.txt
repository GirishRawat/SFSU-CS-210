# CSC 210 *Assignment 1

## How the program runs:
* Asks for number of classes the user took
* Checks if the classes are inclusive of [4,7]
* Ask for grades for all the classes
  * Converts all the grades entered to upper case 
  * Checks if the grade entered is valid
* Reports all the grades back to user
* Prints the total points scored and the GPA

## Challenges I faced:
* Was trying to while-loop while checking if the grade entered is valid or not. Would have been a very lengthy condition to check. Used switch statement instead.
