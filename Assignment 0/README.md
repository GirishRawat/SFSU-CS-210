# CSC 210 *Assignment 0*

**A tiny exercise to make sure you have a working environment.**
To complete this assignment, you must first have a working environment
set up for writing programs in CSC 210.
Download the community version of IntelliJ IDEA here:
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/.
I’ll be posting a video, walking you through the process if you run in to any
issues.
You are welcome to use any text editor you are comfortable with.
As discussed in class, this will be a simple program, using “System.out.prinln”, to
