# SFSU - *CS 210*

**CSC 210** is the first programming course in the CS program for students who have no
programming experience. Design, implementation, testing, debugging, maintenance, and documentation of
programs. Algorithms, programming concepts, and data types. Concepts of objectoriented
programming. 

## Topics

Main topics include the following:
1. Data types: unsigned integers, signed integers, real numbers, and alphanumeric
characters.
2. Number systems and binary coding: unsigned and signed integers, integer
operations, floating point numbers
3. Problem solving using computers.
4. Java data types: int, float, double, short, long, unsigned, char, enum, bool.
5. Arithmetic operators, arithmetic expressions, and basic library functions.
6. The concept of stream input and output.
7. Java selections: if, if-else, switch-case. Programs with selections.
8. Java repetitions and jumps: while, do-while, and for loops, break, continue, exit,
and return. Use of menus and sentinel loops.
9. Methods and their arguments. Local and global variables. The concept of scope. The concept of method overloading.
10. Arrays and array operations: search, sort, reduction, compression, expansion. Basic multi-dimensional arrays.
11. Java strings and text I/O.
12. Files: file streams, file open and close operations, reading from files and
writing into files.
13. Classes and processing of objects: constructors, private and public objects, data initialization, and class member functions. Problem solving techniques.
14. Programming problems with classes and files.
15. Sample algorithms: linear search, binary search, simple sorting algorithms
16. Simple GUI programming.
